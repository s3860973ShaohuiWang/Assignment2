                                Kane is classified as an ENTP-A. He is extroverted, intuitive, and assertive, and is a visual learner.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Bijaya is an ISFP-T. She is reserved, averse to conversation, and prefers to work alone.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Shaohui has been determined to be an ENTJ-T. He can look at things objectively, fills leadership roles easily, and is an auditory learner.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Rishi is an INFP-T. He is seemingly shy but passionate, open to new ideas, and is a hands-on learner.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Vita is defined as an ENTJ-T. She is ambitious, organized, and a visual learner. 
                                <br/><br/>
                                Overall, this leads us to believe that the group will be able to cooperate smoothly. Rishi and Bijaya might be a bit on the shy side, but their productivity will be drawn out easily with Jason’s compassion and Kane’s intuitiveness. Jason will most likely be the conflict mediator. Shaohui will most-likely fill the leadership role, with the help of Vita’s organizational tendencies. Everyone’s learning styles are all over the place, so the team will have to be trained meticulously. Even though most of the team are visual learners, the training cannot be catered to just their needs. The team’s auditory and hand-on learners will need training accommodation, as well.

                                Kane is a third-generation Italian painter who completed high school in Werribee. He has studied Latin, Chinese, French, and Italian. Kane spent three years studying Latin and Italian, but the most challenging language for him to learn was Chinese. Kane’s interest in IT comes from growing up with technology. His childhood was deeply interwoven with computers and interactions with websites such as YouTube and Myspace. His experience with IT has included his hobby of building PC’s for family and friends and partaking in paid side-jobs photoshopping and video editing.

                            <br/><br/>
                            Jason – Out of the 10 top regarded skills he has 9. This is because of the work requiring a lot of general skills to perform as he is at the senior level.

                            Bijaya – After seeing the Burning Glass data, my ideal job has changed slightly. Although I still want to pursue a career in the field of Information Technology, I aim to specialise in one specific area and focus on gaining knowledge and skills for it instead of having a broad knowledge on a wide range areas. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Jason -  After looking at the burning glass data, my opinion of my ideal job has not really changed that much. However, it has given me a better insight into what is required and expected of me to obtain a position as a system/network administrator.

                            An interview was conducted to give an insight into the daily lifestyle of an IT professional. The following is a summary of that interview conducted with Bryan Doan, an IT professional currently working in the field.  
                            <br/><br/>
                            Bryan is a System Administrator at Dynalectric based in Dulles, Virginia in the USA. Dyanlectric is an electrical/construction company responsible for the construction and maintenance of data centers. The company has partaken in the construction of data centers for well-known brands such as Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. Bryan has been working for Dynalectric for 3 years, starting off as an IT helpdesk employee.  
                            <br/><br/>
                            Bryan’s main responsibilities in this role involve server maintenance and troubleshooting as well dealing with IT helpdesk escalations. On the rare occasion Bryan is required to travel to jobsites or the company warehouse if required. As he has experience working with certain applications that none of his colleagues have adequate knowledge or experience of, he often finds himself taking over support tickets from his fellow IT co-workers. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Apart from the IT aspects of his work, Bryan finds that most of his time is consumed by attending meetings. He is in constant communications with the parent and sister companies working with Dynalectric. This includes personnel from the corporate level and their IT departments. Within Dynalectric, Bryan’s helpdesk role sees him interacting with a variety of people ranging from members of upper management such as the CFO and subforeman to general office personal. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Bryan suggests that although he had certifications that helped him secure a position at Dynalectric, networking with people is an important aspect to acquiring a job. He clarifies that it is better to show people what you know you can do as a resume can only say so much. He also advises that the most challenging aspect of his work is time management. He explains that making time between meetings and prioritsing issues based on importance can be quite challenging.

                            Cybersecurity involves techniques and processes designed to secure and protect various digital components such as computing devices, data, and networks from unauthorized digital access by hackers, Cybercriminals, etc. Cybersecurity can be implemented in multiple ways depending on the type of Cyberattacks the system is prone to.

                            A Cyberattack is when hackers attempt to obtain or damage data, networks, or systems by various means in order to generate profit. There are many different types of Cyberattacks such as malware attack, phishing, man-in-the-middle attack, denial of service attack, etc. A malware attack is when a user or victim unintentionally downloads any suspicious attachments with malicious viruses embedded in them causing corruption in the system. A phishing attack is when the victim is sent fraudulent emails or messages that appear to be coming from a legitimate source in order to obtain sensitive information or install malware. The man-in-the-middle attack is when the hacker gains access to the information path between the victim’s device and the website server to which sensitive information is being provided to. Denial of service attack (DOS) is attacking the web by bombarding it with millions of fake requests for information which will tie up the server, forcing it to reply to so many requests making it unable to perform its usual functions.

                            There are many factors that must be taken into consideration in order to prevent Cyberattacks. Using authentication mechanisms allows the devices to identify the authorised user. This is simply done by entering a username and an associated password which is used to identify the account and ensure that the user is an authorised individual. Authentication can be enhanced through two-way authentications where the user is required to log in using a username and password which auto generates a ‘one-time password’ through a server and is sent to a registered device. This way, there is an added layer of security where you are not only relying on the password but also a third device to which the hacker needs physical access to. Another way to ensure protection from Cyberattacks is by installing Antivirus software to look out for viruses, trojans, and malware. This software will scan the websites that are visited and connections that are made through the device to ensure that all activity is authorized and legitimate. Installing a firewall on a system or server ensures that only required services are running on the device. Disabling unwanted services limits the threats that the device is likely to face. These are only a few techniques designed to protect users from falling victims to Cybercrime.

                            In the future, Cybercrime rates are going to be higher than ever as most homes will own smart devices like voice assistants, voice-activated lights, vacuum cleaners and so on which will be easy access for hackers who are trying to gain access to sensitive details. Although these gadgets do not contain any sensitive information themselves, they link to other devices that do, and these devices will become vulnerable access points for Cyberattacks. In order to prevent such incidents and protect users, these rising threats require skilled Cybersecurity professionals to ensure safety for the users. Strong incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can also be expected in Cybersecurity in the future as AI can improve the analysis and study of Cybercrime and enhance Cybersecurity techniques that are used to combat Cybercrimes and protect users.

                            Although AI systems can help to identify incoming threats, they can also be misused by Cybercriminals to discover vulnerable users and make them victims of their attack. Cybercriminals will gain the ability to control an organization’s electricity network or cut off the water supply after taking over its AI system. Identity fraudsters can use AI to generate deepfakes and pretend to be authorised users in order to gain access to the system. However, deepfakes can be overcome through constant verification systems such as tracking eye movement, advanced facial recognition, keystrokes, and so on to ensure that the user is an authorised personnel.

                            In order to prevent such incidents from happening, more job opportunities will open up for skilled Cybersecurity professionals. Cybersecurity is employed by organizations to protect their infrastructure from potential digital harms and threats to their networks or systems. According to Industry Statistics, the jobs that will be in high demand in the future are Network Security Engineer, Cyber Security Analysis, Security Architect, Cyber Security Manager, and Chief Informations Security Officer. These jobs all require skilled Cybersecurity professionals who have the ability to protect users from threats and Cyberattacks. Cybersecurity professionals use various techniques to protect users such as running vulnerability scanners to identify potential flaws within the infrastructure. They monitor the systems and observe the data flow to the internet and check for malicious activity within the network. After the weaknesses are identified, Cybersecurity professionals will test to validate the existence of those weaknesses, and repair and strengthen them by installing Firewalls or Antivirus software.

                            Although we cannot put an end to providing our personal data to organisations nor erase the data that we have already provided, it is important that we have control over who has access to it. Cybersecurity will continue to play a tremendous role going forward as we continue to engage with the world through technology. Cybersecurity will bring a certain level of assurance that the information that we provide is safe and secure and is being handled with confidentiality and care to some extent. This means that we will have more control over who can access our informations as well as our devices. We can avoid being targeted by hackers who are trying to gain access to our information for profit. Therefore, my family and I can ensure that we provide our payment details to legitimate companies when purchasing goods without worrying whether the information we provide is secure. My family will also be less likely to receive any fraudulent emails and if they do, they will be warned against clicking or downloading any malicious links that may cause damage. Furthermore, my family can rest assured that man-in-the-middle attacks will be infrequent and undisruptive to the traffic that is being received and sent to our households thus securing data that needs to remain anonymous. As a result of tightened improvements of cybersecurity, it would be assumed that further prevention of denial-of-service attacks would be implemented, allowing access to crucial services when needed. This can be considered essential regarding medical, police or fire services thus affecting everyone in need of these services.

                            Information technology is changing the economic processes of the modern age. In this ever-evolving technological era, even our financial structures are digitizing. At the basis of every financial system are transactional records and organization of ledgers. Blockchain technology is paving the way for a new sub-field of economics, as well as revolutionizing the way businesses operate and general ledgers are recorded. Blockchain is a shared record that is irreversible and passed through a “chain” of users. This technology facilitates the transference of information immediately and transparently. Transactions such as payments, orders, deposits, and others are easily tracked.  
                            <br/><br/>
                            Digitizing the record-keeping process provides an enormous benefit to financial institutions, as they spend a lot of money and time on organizing their various records. However, the benefit does not have to stop there. The burgeoning field of blockchain technology opens the door to a new form of currency, free from the constraints of a centralized financial authority. Cryptocurrency is essentially a digital form of money. However, it is not standardized globally and is not accepted by all financial institutions. This will undoubtedly change soon. Cryptocurrency is basically a digital money voucher, and so it can be easily regulated by blockchain without much need for human administration. Blockchain’s immutability provides a safe space for the exchange of this new type of currency.

                            Blockchain is a state-of-the-art technology because it digitizes the arduous record-keeping process found in all financial systems. Third parties that are usually held accountable (such as bankers and brokers) could be rendered obsolete in the distant future. This would be possible if the global currency standard transitioned into cryptocurrencies. While that sounds unrealistic, certain government bodies are fully embracing the idea and attempting to implement it. China, for instance, is currently in the process of implementing digital currency. Trials for “Digital Currency Electronic Payment” (DC/EP) are still running in many cities across China. However, the general consensus about this digital yuan is that it is not a typical digital currency. Cryptocurrency began as a rejection of central financial authority, while the DC/EP is controlled by China’s central bank and represents an increase in control and regulation. Regardless of its intention, China’s movement towards digital currency show that what was once considered a science-fiction dream could be a reality in as soon as three years.

                            The rapid speed and momentum of modern technological progress has made blockchain possible. The power of interconnectivity offered to us by the current state of the internet is the only reason we have access to this technology today. The speediness of blockchain transactions are made possible by a technology called “smart contracts”. It is a set of rules programmed into any given blockchain. Conditions for transactions are defined and automated. The major selling-point of blockchain is its efficient approach to keeping irreversible ledgers. This technology offers automatically executed record-keeping within set standards. There is no need to cross-check records, as that process is also automated, saving participants a lot of time and effort. Without “smart contracts”, blockchain would not have such powerful potential.

                            Blockchain and cryptocurrencies will revolutionize economies on a micro and macro level. In the long run, all things that can be digitized will be digitized. Cryptocurrencies may very well wipe out all centrally issued currencies. While this may sound impossible, so did many technological concepts before their actual inception. E-mail is still in the process of making snail mail completely obsolete. People may no longer send or receive physical mail within the next few years. Even now, the only physical mail most people receive are either bills or advertisements. Seeing the impact e-mail had on a historically established system like the mailing system gives us hope for a similar effect from blockchain and cryptocurrencies. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            On a business level, it will make record-keeping more efficient and direct. Not only will blockchain technology cut the costs of transactions and their subsequent ledgers, but it will also minimize the potential mistakes found regularly in the classic, error-prone methods of yesterday. When the middleman is cut out, the transactional process is speedier. This record-keeping does not apply to only businesses. All sorts of tracing and data collection is made possible by blockchain technology. IBM Food Trust (in conjunction with Raw Seafoods) currently uses blockchain to trace seafood in restaurants and grocers all the way back to the boats on which it was caught. This efficiently enables more accountability in the food supply chain. Other industries, such as healthcare, will benefit from blockchain’s immutable record-keeping capabilities, as well.  
                            <br/><br/>
                            Error prevention and dispute resolution will be things of the past once blockchain overtakes our current, multifaceted ledger systems. Paperwork will be replaced with this more streamlined process. Eventually everyone will be affected by this new technology, especially considering how much time and money it saves. Any business, small or large, will be shooting themselves in the foot by sticking to their old record-keeping methods. Entire industries can be reworked around blockchain technology. Things such as photographs, payment records, and permits can be accessed by relevant parties with the click of a mouse. While this is doable now, very little organizational effort is put behind blockchain tech, making it the superior choice overall.

                            I did not know much about blockchain or cryptocurrency before writing this report. Learning about the basics of blockchain has piqued my interest in the technology. For now, it will not affect my life much. However, I shall continue my self-edification journey and engage in more research on the topic. Once I feel that I have sufficient familiarity with blockchain technology and its various associated cryptocurrencies, I may attempt to make some investments. That will most likely be the extent of my direct involvement with blockchain.  
                            <br/><br/>
                            As far as indirect involvement is concerned, I can see my life being affected dramatically. No longer will I be concerned about the source of my food, or potential food safety issues. Blockchain technology is being implemented on a wide scale regarding food safety and pathogen tracing. Eventually, I will be able to eat in a restaurant comfortably because all foods there will be verifiably safe to consume, and pre-traced before entering that restaurant’s kitchen. Any business I frequent may begin to use blockchain technology in the future. If they do, they will be able to serve their customers more effectively, and so I am positively affected, as well. They will have more time and money to spend on the customers’ experience, as they will not have to waste labour or other resources on meticulous book-keeping.

                            My family and friends back home in the United States could be very positively affected by blockchain technology. The US has been enduring unfortunately high COVID case numbers throughout this pandemic. If blockchain was to be implemented in contact-tracing, perhaps the case numbers could be lessened, and the danger of exposure could be mitigated. Most of my family has thankfully recovered from COVID, but perhaps they never would have been exposed to the virus at all if contact-tracing had been a more streamlined process with the help of blockchain tech. As far as cryptocurrency is concerned, my friends and family may also choose to make investments, and potentially profit.

                            Fully autonomous vehicles are still a whiles way from being a common eyesight on our roads and to understand the state of this technology, you have to understand the different levels of autonomy. The SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) defines there to be 6 levels of driving automation. This ranges from Level 0, described as ‘No Driving Automation’, a level where the vehicle is completely controlled by a human although there may be different systems that help the driver, for example, the emergency braking system. This in contrast to Level 5 vehicles which do not require human attention and can do anything that an experienced human driver can do.  As Level 5 is the end all be all, this is what and where autonomous technology are striving to become. As of the present day, you will find that most new cars are Level 2 autonomy which can be best described as Partial Driving Automation. At this level, the car can take control of the acceleration, braking and steering; this is best seen in features such as auto-parking. These features are found in vehicles from brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Toyota etc. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            As of today, there is not a production car in the world that can be classified as Level 3 autonomous although Tesla’s new FSD beta is seemingly closing the gap. With real-time adaptability and ability to navigate through traffic, it is hard whether or not Tesla’s eligible EV’s already meet the threshold. Whether or not you agree that Tesla has already succeeded with creating a true autonomous vehicle, it seems to be that the public’s opinion is that they will be the first ones. This thinking is demonstrative in the price of their shares as we have seen it rocket in the last few years. Although being known for having poor build quality and locking features such as speed increases behind software paywalls, it has not stopped shares from being worth $65(USD) in Jan 2019th climbing to a staggering $880(USD) in Jan 2021. That is not to say that other influences such as marketing has not influenced the price, but it is hard to argue that their position on the automotive race has not boosted their valuation. With Tesla fronting the lead of autonomous vehicles, all negative connotations associated with autonomy is splashed back onto them. The ethics and morals behind machine driven cars has always been questioned; should the car save the driver or the pedestrian? There’s also other questions such as ‘Who’s to blame if a car driving itself kills someone? Is it the driver who wasn’t driving or the company that made it?’. There are not right and wrong answers when it comes to tackling such a hefty question like this but that does not mean we can leave the answer blank. This recently prominent as of the 20th of April 2021, a fatal incident in Texas occurred where a Tesla that investigators state were “100% sure” had no one driving it ran off the road, hitting a tree, bursting in flames, and resulted in the death of the two men inside. Although there was the “likelihood that someone was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash”, its hard to say who is at fault.  
                            <br/><br/>
                            To further the technology to prevent accidents like this, more extensive training of the autopilot neural network for better depth perception, object detection and semantic segmentation will need to take place. More small and micro-architectural improvements are needed on new silicon chips to maximise performance-per-watt in order to power the full-self-driving systems.

                            This technology, if fully functional and capable of performing tasks associated with that of Level 5 autonomy would greatly impact and change society. If majority of cars on road were to be fully autonomous, the advent of a ‘vehicular cloud’ would circumvent traffic jams and serve as a tool for efficient traffic management. With intelligent computing systems on board and increased sensing power, vehicles would be able to relay information between one another creating a network that precisely pinpoints where each and every car will be. This allows for route planning whereas a collective the cars form of a cloud network sending each car down a path which it minimalizes traffic. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Road safety is likely to change as this new technology remarkably increases road safety as past issues such as blind spots are now irrelevant. Not only would it have great positive effects on traffic flow through suburban and metropolitan areas, but it would also dynamically shift the in-car experience.  
                            <br/><br/>
                            Regardless of what cars look like now, there would need to be a reimagined look of human interaction between humans and machines. Without the need of items such as a steering wheel and pedals, it poses the need for other objects such as windows. For instance, it would be plausible that vehicles with no windows would act as a sort of transportable cinema where customers could relax, sit, and drink whilst the vehicles drive them to their required destination. The possibilities are almost endless as cars would no longer be ‘cars’ perse but be a room on wheels. This cultivates into a reduction of certain industries, notably the taxi industry which would inexistant, forcing a new wave of loss employment but also new employment. It would also be these very people that would be most affected.

                            In day-to-day life, autonomous vehicles are set to change everything. It is a systematic rewriting of the way people transport and how they will conduct their day. For myself, regardless of if I own an autonomous vehicle or not, having these self-driving vehicles be at my disposable on apps such as Uber will differ to how these same apps deliver presently. If traffic optimisation becomes as a result of autonomous vehicles as theorised due to cloud vehicle systems, it could ultimately cut travel time for places that I travel to. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            The main difference for myself and many others will be to having to learn to trust machines to calculate complex decisions that can impact the safety of our lives. Not only this but not having control over the vehicle in any compacity (as depicted in Autonomous Level 5) as pedals, steering wheels, indicators would no longer be existent.  
                            <br/><br/>
                            This type of technology will affect all family or friends depending on how far into the future we are looking. If we were to look 3 years into the future for example, this technology would have a fairly drastically low impact unless there were to be huge breakthroughs such as traversing another autonomous level. If we were looking much further such as 50 years for example, it’s quite obvious that it would change everything that has to do with transport.

                            Robots were once a science fiction novelty in movies and television shows, but in modern day society they have become an essential piece in the growth of human civilisation. There are many variants of robots that have been and are currently in development. They can be categorised into the following classifications: 
                            <br/>
                            - Aerospace 
                            <br/>
                            - Consumer grade robots 
                            <br/>
                            - Disaster Response 
                            <br/>
                            - Drones 
                            <br/>
                            - Education 
                            <br/>
                            - Entertainment 
                            <br/>
                            - Humanoid 
                            <br/>
                            - Industrial 
                            <br/>
                            - Medical 
                            <br/>
                            - Military and Security 
                            <br/>
                            - Research 
                            <br/>
                            - Telepresence 
                            <br/>
                            - Underwater  
                            <br/><br/>
                            The peak of current robot technology can be seen in the development of Sophia, a Hanson Robotics project which has claimed to be the most advanced human-like robot. Other robots of this calibre include the Asimo robot by Honda and the Atlas robot by Boston Dynamics. These robots can be seen performing human like tasks such as Sophia’s capability to have a conversation and display human like facial expression, or the acrobatics and life like movements of Asimo and Atlas.  
                            <br/><br/>
                            Theoretically, robots could be capable of doing almost anything. The main factor determining what a robot can be able to do would come down to time and money spent on development and resources. As of today, we can see that companies who are heavily invested in robotics can achieve great things. These achievements include: 
                            <br/>
                            - Landing a robot on another planet for exploration and research purposes as NASA has managed to do with their Mars rovers. 
                            <br/>
                            - Creating exoskeleton suits to help people with limited mobility. 
                            <br/>
                            - The increase in industrial productivity with the application of robots in an assembly line 
                            <br/>
                            - The use of robots in potentially dangerous environments or situations like those used in disaster response or military scenarios. 
                            <br/>
                            - Self-driving cars which can help to reduce human error related car accidents. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            The list of what robots can do could be endless as there are so many ways to build and program a robot for whatever the intended purpose may be. In the upcoming years, we may see robots such as Sophia, Asimo and Atlas make their way into society as workers. As these robots are capable of human-like movements, there may come a day when jobs like product delivery, warehouse pick packing or even a servant/caretaker at home may see one of these or similar robots take a position as.  
                            <br/><br/>
                            The advancement of technology itself, in terms of hardware and software, will have a direct correlation to what robots will be capable of. The types of robots that existed a few decades ago were limited by the processing power available to them at the time. Another area in technological development that goes hand in hand with robots is artificial intelligence. The constant leaps in progress of artificial intelligence has greatly pushed the boundary of the potential robots have. Artificial intelligence has essentially become a part of robotics and is commonly associated with how robots are currently being developed.

                            What is the likely impact?

                            The ongoing development of robots and potential impact it may have on society is a topic that has been discussed regularly. The main concerns society face is the outcome of using robots in place of humans. This topic could be seen as a positive outcome, potentially ending the need to have jobs in high-risk areas or repetitive labour, giving people more freedom and time to do what they wish. The negative to this is that if not implemented correctly, many people may lose their livelihoods and without a system to take place, such as a universal basic income, it could lead to an economical disaster and many people unable to afford basic living needs. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Another topic that has caught a lot of attention is the weaponisation of robots for military purposes. There are many discussions on regulating the use of robots in war as there are two sides of this issue. The ability to stop risking humans going to war and potentially saving thousands of live is a main pushing point for people and organisations on the side of weaponsing robots. The other side of this topic is the complications of regulating how these types of robots could be used and the possible dangers that come with weaponising robots. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Regardless of whether there will be a positive or negative impact from employing robots more into society, it is something that seems to be inevitable. There will be jobs lost but also jobs created as maintenance is something that machines require on a regular basis. Therefore the more robots created for work, the more work is created for maintaining these robots.

                        <h7>
                            The effects of implementing robots into one’s personal lifestyle could be seen as somewhat liberating. Potentially providing more free time as the need to do busy work such as vacuuming or other general housework can be done with robots. The downside to this is the potential cost of purchasing these robots, the upkeep of maintenance and the reliance on robots to carry out tasks which can cause someone to become very complacent. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            For someone who has a passion for IT and is also looking for a career in the industry, the development of robots can be seen to have a highly positive impact. As we are still in the early stages of developing robots for common use in society, it is exciting to is how the progress of robotics as well as the reaction people have to it unfolds.

                            The chosen app for Group 8 is an instructional, educational car-based service. This app will allow the user to quickly navigate and find any car information they require, such as instructions on how to properly change a flat tyre or what to do in the event of an overheating car. The use of this automotive app is to provide users who are in dire need of assistance regarding a faulty car instruction on how to cater to it, in order to get it running safety to the best ability. As the application is made to be used generally within emergency situations, it is able to download the crucial data to be used in offline cases. The target market is individuals in between 16-26, as in this age people commonly drive cars or are learning to drive on their own. They use phones and smart technology far more than older generations leading to the likelihood of them having charged and working smartphones with them to gain their help.

                            The motivation to create this app is due to the increasing lack of basic car maintenance procedures and common emergency situations within younger generations. This is alarming, as the ability and licence to drive is something that will increase the likelihood of having to deal with car issues, one ensuring that they know what to do in common faulty car situations will be very beneficial. As we had taken time to look for apps or websites of this certain service and our inspection had shown that there was little to no apps of this variety. An app was suited to be the best option for the young individuals as this is more versatile and handier than having to carry a manual along with you in addition to this, it is more common for young adults to have a working smart phone on them to search.

                            A description of the idea “PocketMechanic” will be an app that is targeting 16-26 year old’s, this means that it would be more beneficial for young adults to do a questionnaire initially as soon as they get on the app for the first time. The questionnaire will be used to determine the exact type of car that the app user drives, although there is a skip button available for the user to skip the questionnaire and get straight to the application. It is recommended that a user does use the questionnaire as it presents information regarding the specific car of the user. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            There will be a bottom border with three different buttons, the first from the right being ‘Common issues’ to ‘Search issues’ and ‘Contact us’. This is done like this because it provides the user with the ability to ensure that they can search issues if they know exactly what they are searching for, which provides issues that occur the most frequently and the solutions to the problems. If there is no luck and there is no chance at finding the users desired issue, there is the function of ‘Contact us’, in which there will be a 24/7 call centre to assist with direct calls. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            In the event of the car questionnaire not taking place, there is still full functioning of the app although it gives general advice and common issues regarding all cars, this can be enough to satisfy the user but not as in depth as the exact car model search. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            A very useful component of the questionnaire that is not available in as much depth as the common search is the videos, the exact car model and type will allow for the common issues regarding the car to have a video instruction to help guide the user through the exact movements and steps. Although the video implementation will be a later done component, the app will be made with images and written information and videos can be updated in as the application grows. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            As getting information you need from the app is essential, there is also different language settings that will be available to cater to individuals who are more fluent in a different language. In relation to the video segments, we plan to provide subtitles under the video and as the user needs grow then different language presented videos can be added. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            As it was mentioned before that the app will download the information in order to allow offline use for emergency cases, there is also options available to download videos and certain information about certain cars. This will allow people who do not have a lot of storage or do not want to waste storage on information they will not require.

                            The tools and tech that’s required to complete this job is the programming software used to either make the website or app, swift and atom can do this. In terms of getting, it up and running you need extra sources which are Git and XCode, as this will be necessary to test it out. Cloud servers are useful in the case that it becomes a real application.

                            It is essential to learn to write with a programming language in order to create the application, swift is an option that is easy to access and there are many sources in order to learn how to write it yourself. XCode is necessary in order to test the application and it is available to use freely and it will be required to learn how to navigate and use the software.

                            If this project becomes successful then it will be a great asset for the private transport users, who are younger individuals. This app was designed to provide those who have little to no knowledge about automotive servicing a path to fix problems themselves, in the form that suits them best. It is essential to keep in mind that although this will be very beneficial for individuals, its role is to assist drivers to get their car running safely until they can manage to get it to a suitable and safe location. I believe that this will result in less use of emergency care services such as RACV on minor issues like a flat tyre, providing the more extreme and necessary support to those who need it more. This can provide the road users more ease when driving as there will less holdups in traffic with individuals knowing how to deal with problems sooner, allowing everyone to get to where they need to be.

                            I felt like there were no issues between group members and everyone was willing to cooperate and help out another member if they needed it. The meetings allowed a time for people to contribute ideas to one another and allow feedback on areas that needed polishing or refining.

                            I’d say that everyone not having mics (possibly feeling uncomfortable to use them?) hinders communication a bit within meetings but is nothing too significant that renders our meetings useless.

                            Everyone was thoroughly pleased with the communication level of the group. The team was overall cooperative, and no significant issues arose. Meeting attendance was nearly impeccable. People attended the meetings punctually, and everyone felt that the contribution levels were more or less equivalent. At the very least, the delegation of tasks were allocated in a way to help even the spread of the heavy workload. There was little hesitation in assisting and supporting other members of the team.

                            We could have managed our time more wisely as we were off to late start. Although this didn’t impact us greatly, it would have definitely given us more time to complete our project if we had started earlier. During the MS Teams meetings, not everyone had access to mics or was comfortable turning their mics on during the meeting. This didn’t impact our sessions at a large scale but would have helped run the meetings smoother. However, despite this, everyone in the group still participated in the conversations through the chat feature.

                            One thing that was surprising was the amount of cooperation shown by all team members. Everyone was willing to help each other out and take up different part of the project without hesitation or conflict. Everyone was very understanding about one another’s personal commitments and were able to provide any assistance if needed. Everyone was able to share the workload evenly without anyone having to do too much and anyone not completing their part of the task.

                            We learned that strong communication and punctuality are key components to a smoothly-operating team. Without strong organization, projects can get side-tracked and go off the rails. Communication helped keep us all on track. Without speaking clearly to each other about our needs and expectations of the team, we never would have been able to get a project of this size done by the deadline. Efficiency is not achievable without cooperation and support. It would seem that all of the team members of Group 8 have learned about the power of communication through Assignment 2.
